    SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS = {
        "apple": {
            "APPS": [{
                # Your service identifier.
                "client_id": "your.service.id",

                # The Key ID (visible in the "View Key Details" page).
                "secret": "KEYID",

                 # Member ID/App ID Prefix -- you can find it below your name
                 # at the top right corner of the page, or itâ€™s your App ID
                 # Prefix in your App ID.
                "key": "MEMAPPIDPREFIX",

                "settings": {
                    # The certificate you downloaded when generating the key.
                    "certificate_key": """-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----

Apple offers two distinct client IDs: a "Bundle ID" and a "Services ID". When
the flow is started from a mobile iOS device the bundle ID is used, whereas a
web authorization flow uses the services ID as the client ID. If you need to
support both client IDs within one project, add an app entry (over at ``APPS``)
for each client ID. For the app specifying the bundle ID, add the following to
the settings so that this app does not show up on the web::

    "settings": { "hidden": True, ... }


Note: Sign In With Apple uses a slight variation of OAuth2, which uses a POST
instead of a GET. Unlike a GET with SameSite=Lax, the session cookie will not
get sent along with a POST. If you encounter 'PermissionDenied' errors during
Apple log in, check that you don't have any 3rd party middleware that is
generating a new session on this cross-origin POST, as this will prevent the
login process from being able to access the original session after the POST
completes.
