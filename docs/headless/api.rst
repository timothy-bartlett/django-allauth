API
===

You can find the documentation for the API itself in its `OpenAPI Specification
<openapi-specification/>`_.

Example
*******

The source code repository contains a
`React example application <https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth/tree/main/examples/react-spa>`_ that
demonstrates how the API can be put to use in practice. The documentation for that application can be found in the `README <https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth/tree/main/examples/react-spa/README.org>`_. Instructions on how to run it locally can be found there as well, though you can also view a copy running over at `react.demo.allauth.org <https://eact.demo.allauth.org>`_.
