Or, add to meta in response?
Disabled, let's not complicate things.

**** TODO Social signin

**** TODO MFA

**** TODO OpenAPI Spec

**** TODO Documentation

**** TODO Test coverage

**** DONE Change password vs ACCOUNT_LOGOUT_ON_PASSWORD_CHANGE

**** TODO Investigate a headless-only mode
=HEADLESS_ONLY = True=  ?

**** TODO Check interaction with user sessions
Mobile sesions to also show up.

**** TODO Prevent enumeration
During signup, there is indeed a pending flow. But, given that this is not
stored int the session a subsequent call to the endpoint reveals a different
response from which an enumeration related conclusion can be drawn.

**** TODO Provider redirect vs token vs ...
Need a way of indicating what mechanisms are supported.

**** TODO Check caching headers

**** TODO Pass along success/error to redirect callback
E.g. the frontend connect process needs to be able to show a "Provider
Connected!" message (or failure).

**** TODO Revisit URL structure
Having underscores as =mfa_authenticate= and =verify_email= in URLs? Matches stages, but...

**** TODO Decide if API needs to be made more REST-ish
e.g. =POST= to /2fa/authenticators/totp/{id} to delete? But TOTP is a singleton, so why.

**** TODO Decide upon __all__
Perhaps use '*' ? or '_'...
